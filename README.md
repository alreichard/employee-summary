# employee-summary
## Description
In this project, I used inquire prompts and classes to create a webpage with information on different members of a company team: manager, engineers, and interns. I created this app because creating easy templates like this for companies would cut down on unnecessary labor. I also used this as an oportunity to increase my knowledge on using classes and prompts. Along with that, I learned how to use recursion with functions, which is necessary for the "inquirer" package, since it relies heavily on order of operation. The importance of classes became more clear as I saw how easy it is to call specific elements from them when transfering to the html side.

## Installation 

## Usage
This program allows the user to create a web page describing the important information on different members of a company. It is as simple as responding to the prompt given in the terminal.
